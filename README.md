# GettingStartedWithTensorFlow
Learning TensorFlow using the book "Getting Started with TensorFlow"

Learn TensorFlow from book "Getting Started with TensorFlow" by Giancarlo Zaccone. Learning from a book might help setting and achieving milestones on learning. Sifting through Google's TensorFlow pages didn't lead to much progress and hence this book. The book has typos and also refers to TensorFlow aspects that may have changed already.
